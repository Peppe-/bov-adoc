    <para>
        This chapter describes how to use Vaadin Spreadsheet, a Vaadin add-on component
        for displaying and editing Excel spreadsheets within any Vaadin application.

        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>
            Spreadsheet applications have been the sonic screwdriver of business
            computation and data collection for decades. In recent years, spreadsheet web
            services have become popular with cloud-based services that offer better
            collaboration, require no installation, and some are even free to
            use. However, both desktop and third-party cloud-based services are difficult
            to integrate well with web applications. Being a Vaadin UI component, Vaadin
            Spreadsheet allows complete integration with Vaadin applications and further
            with the overall system. The ability to work on Excel spreadsheets allows
            desktop interoperability and integration with document management.
        </para>

        <para>
            By eliminating the dependency on third-party cloud-based services, Vaadin
            Spreadsheet also gives control over the privacy of documents. Growing security
            concerns over cloud-based information storage have increased privacy
            requirements, with lowering trust in global third-party providers. Vaadin
            applications can run on private application servers, and also in the cloud if
            necessary, allowing you to prioritize between security and local and global
            availability.

            Vaadin Spreadsheet is a UI component that you use much like any other
            component. It has full size by default, to use all the available space in the
            containing layout. You can directly modify the cell data in the active
            worksheet by entering textual and numerical values, as well as using Excel
            formulas for spreadsheet calculations.
        </para>

        <programlisting lang="java"><![CDATA[Spreadsheet sheet = new Spreadsheet();
sheet.setWidth("400px"); // Full size by default
sheet.setHeight("250px");

// Put customary greeting in a cell
sheet.createCell(0, 0, "Hello, world");

// Have some numerical data
sheet.createCell(1, 0, 6);
sheet.createCell(1, 1, 7);

// Perform a spreadsheet calculation
sheet.createCell(1, 2, ""); // Set a dummy value
sheet.getCell(1, 2).setCellFormula("A2*B2");

// Resize a column to fit the cell data
sheet.autofitColumn(0);

layout.addComponent(sheet);
layout.setSizeFull(); // Typically]]></programlisting>

            Cell values and formulas can be set, read, and styled through the server-side
            API, so you can easily implement custom editing features through menus or
            toolbars.
        </para>

        <para>
            Full integration with a Vaadin application is reached through the server-side
            access to the spreadsheet data as well as visual styling. Changes in cell
            values can be handled in the Vaadin application and you can use almost any
            Vaadin components within a spreadsheet.
        </para>

        <para>
            Vaadin Spreadsheet uses Apache POI to work on Microsoft Excel documents. You
            can access the Apache POI data model to perform low-level tasks, although you
            should note that if you make modifications to the data model, you have the
            responsibility to notify the spreadsheet to update itself.

        <title>Basic Use</title>

        <para>
            <classname>Spreadsheet</classname> is a Vaadin component, which you can use as
            you would any component. You can create it, or load from an Excel file, create
            cells and new sheets, define formulas, and so forth. In the following, we go
            through these basic steps.

            <title>Creating a Spreadsheet</title>

            <para>
                The default constructor for <classname>Spreadsheet</classname> creates an
                empty spreadsheet with a default sheet. The spreadsheet component has full
                size by default, so the containing layout must have defined size in both
                dimensions; a spreadsheet may not have undefined size.
            </para>

            <para>
                In the following example, we create an empty spreadsheet with a fixed
                size and add it to a layout.
            </para>

            <programlisting lang="java"><![CDATA[Spreadsheet sheet = new Spreadsheet();

layout.addComponent(sheet);]]></programlisting>

            <para>
                An empty spreadsheet automatically gets an initial worksheet with some
                default size and settings.

                    You can load an Excel file from the local filesystem with a
                    <classname>File</classname> reference or from memory or other source
                    with an <classname>InputStream</classname>.

                <para>
                    If you have an Apache POI workbook created otherwise, you can wrap it
                    to <classname>Spreadsheet</classname> with the respective constructor.
                </para>

                <para>
                    You can access the underlying workbook with
                    <methodname>getWorkbook()</methodname>. However, if you make
                    modifications to the workbook, you must allow the spreadsheet update
                    itself by calling appropriate update methods for the modified element
                    or elements.

            <para>
                A "spreadsheet" in reality works on a <emphasis>workbook</emphasis>, which
                contains one or more <emphasis>worksheets</emphasis>. You can create new
                sheets and delete existing ones with

                <methodname>deleteSheet()</methodname>, respectively.

            <para>
                When a sheet is deleted, the index of the sheets with a higher index is
                decremented by one.  When the active worksheet is deleted, the next one by
                index is set as active, or if there are none, the previous one.
            </para>

            <para>
                All operations on the spreadsheet content are done through the currently
                active worksheet. You can set an existing sheet as active with
                <methodname>setActiveSheetIndex()</methodname>.
