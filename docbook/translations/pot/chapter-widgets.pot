Rendering is done either by manipulating the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) through the lower-level DOM API, or simply by injecting the HTML with <methodname>setInnerHTML()</methodname>.

The Vaadin widgets have somewhat different feature set from the GWT widgets and are foremost intended for integration with the server-side components, but some may prove useful for client-side applications as well."
