    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>
        This book provides an overview of the Vaadin Framework and covers the most
        important topics that you might encounter while developing applications with it. A
        more detailed documentation of the individual classes, interfaces, and methods is
        given in the Vaadin API Reference.
    </para>

    <para>
        The book has grown greatly after its first edition, until it became too thick to
        fit any standard pocket. To accommodate all the content also in the printed
        edition, it has now been split into two volumes, the first one including the
        topics that you need to get started with Vaadin.
    </para>

    <para>
        This edition mostly covers Vaadin 7.3 released in 2014. The most notable feature
        in the release is the new and highly customizable Valo theme.
    </para>

    <para>
        In addition to the changes in the core framework, this edition features
        documentation for the TestBench 4 and TouchKit 4 add-ons, which are not yet
        released at the time of writing. The updated chapters are based on prerelease
        versions of the add-ons, so the final releases may include some changes.
    </para>

    <para>
        Writing this manual is an ongoing work and it is rarely completely up-to-date with
        the quick-evolving product. Some features may not be included in this book yet.
        For the most current version, please see the on-line edition available at
        <uri>http://vaadin.com/book</uri>. You can also find PDF and EPUB versions of the
        book there. You may find the other versions more easily searchable than the
        printed book. The index in the book is incomplete and will be expanded later. The
        web edition also has some additional technical content, such as some example code
        and additional sections that you may need when actually doing development. The
        purpose of the slightly abridged print edition is more to be an introductionary
        textbook to Vaadin, and still fit in your pocket.
    </para>

    <para>
        Also, many Vaadin 7 features are showcased as mini-tutorials, which are available
        in the Vaadin Wiki at <link

        <title>Who is This Book For?</title>

        <para>
            This book is intended for software developers who use, or are considering to
            use, Vaadin to develop web applications.
        </para>

        <para>
            The book assumes that you have some experience with programming in Java, but
            if not, it is at least as easy to begin learning Java with Vaadin as with any
            other UI framework. No knowledge of AJAX is needed as it is well hidden from
            the developer.
        </para>

        <para>
            You may have used some desktop-oriented user interface frameworks for Java,
            such as AWT, Swing, or SWT, or a library such as Qt for C++. Such knowledge is
            useful for understanding the scope of Vaadin, the event-driven programming
            model, and other common concepts of UI frameworks, but not necessary.
        </para>

        <para>
            If you do not have a web graphics designer at hand, knowing the basics of HTML
            and CSS can help so that you can develop presentation themes for your
            application. A brief introduction to CSS is provided. Knowledge of Google Web
            Toolkit (GWT) may be useful if you develop or integrate new client-side
            components.

        <para>
            Much of the book is the result of close work within the development team at
            Vaadin Ltd. Joonas Lehtinen, CEO of Vaadin Ltd, wrote the first outline of the
            book, which became the basis for the first two chapters. Since then, Marko
            Gr&ouml;nroos has become the primary author and editor. The development team
            has contributed several passages, answered numerous technical questions,
            reviewed the manual, and made many corrections.
